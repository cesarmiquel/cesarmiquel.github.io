## Springer Link: a wealth of science related books and articles

Today I received a list of free PDFs links from the Springer editorial. I downloaded several interesting sounding books and then visited the site a bit. I noticed it had a lot of free 'Open Access' papers which means you can read / download PDFs of them. Here's the site: [Springer Link website](https://link.springer.com/)



## Wordpress fundamental plugins

While looking into Wordpress I find several plugins that seem to be 'core' plugins. These are:

- Jetpack - [[web]](https://jetpack.com/) "**Safer. Faster. More traffic.** Security, performance, and marketing tools made for WordPress sites by the WordPress experts". This is the [product tour web page](https://jetpack.com/features/)
- VaultPress - [[web]](https://vaultpress.com/) Wordpress backup and security service. "VaultPress protects you from the most common â€” and most serious â€” security threats."
- Akismet  - [[web]](https://akismet.com/) Filter spam from sites.

## Theme inspiration for green themes

- Ghost themes: [https://ghost.org/marketplace/](https://ghost.org/marketplace/)
- Great post styling: [https://nurui.fueko.net/style-guide/](https://nurui.fueko.net/style-guide/) 

## Markdown, file based CMSs

I wanted a to host this blog with some requirements:
- markdown format - I want to have all my posts as `.md` files
- minimalist pretty Theme
- simple setup

I ended up using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) (a.k.a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)). I found an open source theme I liked and I'm using that ([plainwhite](https://github.com/thelehhman/plainwhite-jekyll)). In the process I found a couple of others I liked. I leave here my list:

- **CirculateCMS** - A PHP based, very minimal CMS. [[web]](https://circulatecms.com/)
- **Textpattern** - Another PHP based CMS. I really liked the webpage. I might use this for another project [[web]](https://textpattern.com/)
- **Grav** - This was another PHP based one I had seen in the paste. Still like it. [[web]](https://getgrav.org/)
- **Ghost** - This is really nice but was too complicated for what I wanted [[web]](https://ghost.org/) [[thems for ghost]](https://ghost.org/marketplace/). One I particularly liked [[blog styles]](https://nurui.fueko.net/style-guide/)

## Max Piantoni: interesting artist / coder

I recently came accross a [[YouTube video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGVfwEEjRfs) of someone who recreated a little animation that is shown on an Apple //c on an 80's movie 'A View To a Kill' (here's the [[github repo]](https://github.com/MaxPiantoni/View-To-A-Kill) with the actual code). His name is Max Piantoni. So I visited his site and he does some interesting crazy projects. Checkout [his site](https://www.maxpiantoni.com/) to see more fun stuff or follow him on [[twitter]](https://twitter.com/maxpiantoni).

## Apple II resources

Browsing around I found several interesting Apple II resources:

- **Apple II Programming FAQ** - http://apple2.org.za/gswv/a2zine/faqs/csa2pfaq.html
- **Beagle brothers programs** - https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ground.icaen.uiowa.edu/apple8/Beagle.Oldies/
- **Asimov** - This FTP has **huge** amounts of technical documents, magazines and source code. [[FTP]](Asimov
- **Vendors and publishers** - http://apple2.org.za/gswv/a2zine/faqs/A2FAQs3VENDORS.html
- **Hardcore computist** - This was a very small magazine with very low level hacks to be able to copy games and do other 'magic'. In here you can find many issues (if not all) [[ftp]](ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/documentation/magazines/hardcore_computist/)
- **Dos and ProDos documentation** - ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/documentation/os/
- **Best of Hardcore computing** - This issue has a lot of cool articles. The most interesting to me describes the boot process and how to 'hack it'. [[ftp]](ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/documentation/magazines/hardcore_computing/best.of.pdf) [[PDF]](files/2020-04-27/best.of.pdf)
- **Emulators** - For Linux there is [LinApple](http://linapple.sourceforge.net/) and a fork in [Github](https://github.com/dabonetn/linapple-pie). These are both ports of [AppleWin](https://github.com/AppleWin)
- **Micro M8** - Another Apple II Emulator that runs in Linux - https://paleotronic.com/software/microm8/
- **Util programs** - This directory in Asimov has loads of disk images to util programs. [[ftp]](ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images/disk_utils/)
- **Gamezzzz** - You want games? This directory is for you: [[ftp games]](ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images/games/). The [[action directory]](ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/images/games/action/) has such classics as Loderuner and Choplifter!
- **ADTPro** - This program can be used to transfer images to an actual Apple II via the serial interface. [[web]]](https://adtpro.com/index.html). To bootstrap (install the software on the actual hardware which will 'recieve' the images: [without using disk drive](https://adtpro.com/bootstrap.html#Starting_with_Virtual_Serial_Drive)

## Sony a6000, a6300, a6500, a6400, a6100 and a6600 comparison

![Sony a6000 lineup](/assets/imgs/2020-04-27/a6000-line.png)

I've been looking into replacing my *Sony a6000* with a newer model so I wanted to see what the current line of Sony a6000 looked like in 2020. After watching a couple of videos I found a really good onw [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Daqp35zNj0) which really covers all 6 available cameras. I'll write my conclusions here to save me time when I finally get to making the purchase:
- The chronological order is: a6000, a6300, a6500, a6400, a6100, a6600
- All models except the a6000 shoot 4k video, 120 frames/sec FullHD, have 425 auto-focus points and have a mic in plug.
- The a6400, a6100 and a6600 have the new flipup screen
- All models except the a6000 and a6100 have a better built (and weather proof) body
- All models except the a6600 have a built-in flash
- The rest of the features I show in a Matrix. They are: flip screen, double resolution viewfinder, no overheating when recordin more than 30min video, better looking menues, lareger battery, image stabilization for the sensor, a new and improved processor and better quality colors.

|Model|flip scr|viewfinder|>1hr rec|touch|menus|large batt|img stab|processor|colors|
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|a6000|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|a6300|-|x|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|a6500|-|x|~|x|x|-|x|-|-|
|a6400|x|x|x|x|x|-|-|x|x|
|a6100|x|-|x|x|x|-|-|x|x|
|a6600|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|x|

Conclusions:

- If you have an a6000 you should update to an a6600, a6400 or a6100 in that order.
- They are **all** awesome camaras, its just a matter of price. For me I'll probably settle on either the a6100 or a6400.
- The a6600 at the current pricepoint is the best of best at that market. The a6400 is the best bang for the buck.
- See all details here: [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Daqp35zNj0) and here a6100 [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waOMbQXhHaE)
- The videos by the author of the previous review is really good and has another video where he shows his favorite lenses for the a6x0 series [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5pTS5TN78I). In this video he recommends the Sigma 16mm prime lens (Sigma 16mm f/1.4 DC DN Contemporary Lens for Sony E).
