## â—» Springer Link: a wealth of science related books and articles

Today I received a list of free PDFs links from the Springer editorial. I downloaded several interesting sounding books and then visited the site a bit. I noticed it had a lot of free 'Open Access' papers which means you can read / download PDFs of them. Here's the site: [Springer Link website](https://link.springer.com/)


### Links ðŸ”—

We usually add a list of links at the end with links related to this

- [Link description](http://example.com/link) Maybe I discuss a little more the link



## â—» Wordpress fundamental plugins

While looking into Wordpress I find several plugins that seem to be 'core' plugins. These are:

- Jetpack - [[web]](https://jetpack.com/) "**Safer. Faster. More traffic.** Security, performance, and marketing tools made for WordPress sites by the WordPress experts". This is the [product tour web page](https://jetpack.com/features/)
- VaultPress - [[web]](https://vaultpress.com/) Wordpress backup and security service. "VaultPress protects you from the most common â€” and most serious â€” security threats."
- Akismet  - [[web]](https://akismet.com/) Filter spam from sites.

## â—» Theme inspiration for green themes

- Ghost themes: https://ghost.org/marketplace/
- Great post styling: https://nurui.fueko.net/style-guide/

## â—» Markdown, file based CMSs

I wanted a to host this blog with some requirements:
- markdown format - I want to have all my posts as `.md` files
- minimalist pretty Theme
- simple setup

I ended up using [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) (a.k.a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)). I found an open source theme I liked and I'm using that ([plainwhite](https://github.com/thelehhman/plainwhite-jekyll)). In the process I found a couple of others I liked. I leave here my list:

- CirculateCMS - A PHP based, very minimal CMS. [[web]](https://circulatecms.com/)
- Textpattern - Another PHP based CMS. I really liked the webpage. I might use this for another project [[web]](https://textpattern.com/)
- Grav - This was another PHP based one I had seen in the paste. Still like it. [[web]](https://getgrav.org/)
- Ghost - This is really nice but was too complicated for what I wanted [[web]](https://ghost.org/) [[thems for ghost]](https://ghost.org/marketplace/). One I particularly liked [[blog styles]](https://nurui.fueko.net/style-guide/)
