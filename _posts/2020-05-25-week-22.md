## Symbolic Mathematics Finally Yields to Neural Networks

I read the article "Symbolic Mathematics Finally Yields to Neural Networks" on Quanta Magazine [[web]](https://www.quantamagazine.org/symbolic-mathematics-finally-yields-to-neural-networks-20200520/) which talks about a paper by a group of researchers from Facebook which uses Neural Networks to analytically solve integration and partial differential equations. The paper uses RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) to represent the equations and then sequence to sequence learning to solve the equations.

## "Rare" 60s cars built in Argentina

This article that appeared in Clarin talks about the 'strange cars' which where built in Argentina in the 60s [[web]](https://www.clarin.com/autos/historias-autos-raros-fabricaron-hace-60-anos-argentina_0_yKj1SZLPM.html). Some pictures follos:

## Jeremy Mann - Sketchbooks,oil paintings, photography and film

I'm watching the ["The Sketchbook Series"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BY_U8Qpbys&list=PLSyQ0NEnXiTQnuAKfU73WGPqAU8QxVd4K) in the *Trojan Horse Was a Unicorn* YouTube channel and came across a new artist I didn't know: **Jeremy Mann**. He is a very prolific and varied artist who explores in photography, drawing, painting and recently film. One interesting hobby mentioned in the video is that he tears appart old camaras and combines them with polaroid film to create a very interesting hybrid photgraphy. Here is some of his artwork and several links to his art.
