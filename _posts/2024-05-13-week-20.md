# NeoVim links and plugins

I created a Github repo to keep my `dotfiles` and while doing some 'research' found several cool Neovim resources/links:

- [alpha/nvim](https://github.com/goolord/alpha-nvim/): a fast and fully programmable greeter for neovim.
- [Some awesome greet examples](https://github.com/goolord/alpha-nvim/discussions/16)
- [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) - Yet another plugin manager. Switched to this one.
- [Exafunction/codeium.vim](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.vim) - Free, ultrafast Copilot alternative for Vim and Neovim

Also found several good neovim lua configurations:

- [olimorris/dotfiles](https://github.com/olimorris/dotfiles)
- [adriankarlen/nvim](https://github.com/adriankarlen/nvim/)
- [cksidharthan/nvim](https://github.com/cksidharthan/nvim)

# Internation space station footage and images

The NASA has great images and videos of the International Space Station. You can find them [here](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/). These are some of the most interesting images and videos I've seen so far:

- [Earth in 4K - Space Station Expedition 67-68 Edition](https://images.nasa.gov/details/jsc2023m000111_Earth_in_4K_Space_Station_Expedition_67_68_Edition) - This video in 4K will blow your mind. There are over 50 minutes of video in it. From this link you can download the raw footage in 4K resolution. Video from April 2023.
- [Earth Views from the International Space Station](https://images.nasa.gov/details/Earth%20Views%20from%20the%20International%20Space%20Station) - A shorter 3 minute video of the ISS.

# Drupal at your fingertips

I have a very useful gist with lots of code samples on using Drupal's APIs. You can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/cesarmiquel/48404d99c8f7d9f274705b7a601c5554). Recently I found a larger and more complete version of my gist: it's called "Drupal at your fingrets". You can find it [here](https://selwynpolit.github.io/d9book/) and the Github repo [here](https://github.com/selwynpolit/d9book).
