- NeoVim links and plugins

# NeoVim links and plugins

I created a Github repo to keep my `dotfiles` and while doing some 'research' found several cool Neovim resources/links:

- [alpha/nvim](https://github.com/goolord/alpha-nvim/): a fast and fully programmable greeter for neovim.
- [Some awesome greet examples](https://github.com/goolord/alpha-nvim/discussions/16)
- [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) - Yet another plugin manager. Switched to this one.
- [Exafunction/codeium.vim](https://github.com/Exafunction/codeium.vim) - Free, ultrafast Copilot alternative for Vim and Neovim

Also found several good neovim lua configurations:

- [olimorris/dotfiles](https://github.com/olimorris/dotfiles)
- [adriankarlen/nvim](https://github.com/adriankarlen/nvim/)
- [cksidharthan/nvim](https://github.com/cksidharthan/nvim)
