## Intereting developer: Max Strauch

His site seems very interesting and neat. Should look into it: [[web]](https://maxstrauch.github.io/). I came to his page because he created a hardware emulated Apple II with an Atme AVR microcontroller. He did his batcherlos thesis which you can download from the site as well. You can watch the machine running here: [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMmLo94A9eU)

## GNU Rocket OpenGL editor

This is an OpenGL editor used by XY the coder of the *Brainwave* 64K demo. [[GitHub]](https://github.com/emoon/rocket)

## Applesoft BASIC Quick Reference

- Applesoft BASIC in JavaScript - [[web]](https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/)
- Very nice reference of Applesoft BASIC - [[web]](https://www.calormen.com/jsbasic/reference.html)

## Jupyter notebook for Apple II palette

I wrote a little snippet of **Jupyter code** to plot the Apple II palette:

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

palette = [
    [  0,  0,  0],[227, 30, 96],[ 96, 78,189],[255, 68,253],
    [  0,163, 96],[156,156,156],[ 20,207,253],[208,195,255],
    [ 96,114,  3],[255,106, 60],[156,156,156],[255,160,208],
    [208,221,141],[ 20,245, 60],[114,255,208],[255,255,255]
]

rgb = []
numColors = 16
for color in range(0, numColors):
    rgb_pixel = palette[ color ]
    rgb.append(int(rgb_pixel[0]))
    rgb.append(int(rgb_pixel[1]))
    rgb.append(int(rgb_pixel[2]))

rgb_m = np.array(rgb)
rgb_m.shape = (4, 4, 3)

plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
plt.imshow(rgb_m, interpolation='none',origin='upper' )
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
```

## Pouet logos

Pouet, the demo scene site is running (always?) a contest to choose logo. Here are a couple of the ones I liked the most

## Macinstosh Emulators

The awesome ['Devine Lu Linvega']() (one half of [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/)) has been playing with Hypercard and Pascal on a Macintosh so it got me interested on Mac emulations. Here are a couple of resources:

- [Notes and links related to the Macintosh II computer.](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/macintosh.html)
- [Mini vMac - a Mac emulator](https://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/index.html)
- [Hypertalk is the programming language used in the mac software Hypercard.](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/hypertalk.html)

## 51 Byte Parallax Scrollbar Apple II demo

This week I worked on an idea for an effect on an Apple II. The seed came from watching this YouTube video of a collection of tiny BBCMicro demos [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgn-evFqZas) and the **Brainwave** 64k Demo entry from Revision '19 [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYyL_mEQWOM&feature=youtu.be&t=1514). In particular this small section:

![Brainwave 3](/assets/imgs/2020-05-04/brainworm-3.png?1)

That part of the demo shows some scrolling bars with different speed and parallax. I wanted to get an idea of how fast the Apple 2 could render graphics using assembler in low res mode. I started with vertical bars (no way I'll attempt to do it diagonal!) and just a single row. I was interested in vertical since on the Apple 2 it makes for thinner bars. I tweaked a little bit and got it down to 175 bytes (I'm sure I can lower that number from my later experience but for the moment I might come back to this later). This is the result:

![Bruna - 175 bytes](/assets/imgs/2020-05-04/bruna.gif)

After that I wanted to try to do this effect (or similiar) with as few bytes as possible. After making lots of tweaks I managed to get it down to 51 bytes. This is how it looks:

![Bruno - 51 bytes](/assets/imgs/2020-05-04/bruno.gif)

Finally to add some variations I created a third version which cycles through 4 colors. Here it is running:

![Bruni - 62 bytes](/assets/imgs/2020-05-04/bruni.gif)

I also uploaded a YouTube video with all them running [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJpT-gt-ZO4). Here's the source for the 62 byte version. You can see all the project on my Apple II development Github project [[GitHub]](https://github.com/cesarmiquel/apple-2-dev/tree/master/my-demos/bruno)
