# Physically Based Rendering

This week I came across the *Physically Based Rendering* book which is a great **free** book on writting a physically based renderer (pbr). The book is great and all the source code for the pbr is available online in Github. It's written in C++. Here are some information:

- [Physically Based Rendering website](https://pbrt.org/) - This is the main website for the project
- [Physically Based Rendering:From Theory To Implementation](https://pbr-book.org/) - This is the third edition book written by: Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, and Greg Humphreys. [Table of contents](https://pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents)
- [Github project with source code](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3) - "This repository holds the source code to the version of pbrt that is described in the third edition of Physically Based Rendering: From Theory to Implementation, by Matt Pharr, Wenzel Jakob, and Greg Humphreys. As before, the code is available under the BSD license."
- [PBRT-V3 Fileformat](https://pbrt.org/fileformat-v3) - The fileformat used to describe the scene is well documented. In addition there are scripts that will convert blender files to `pbrt`
- [Sample images rendered by pbrt](https://pbrt.org/scenes-v3) - A collection of images rendered with the raytracer.

# Shor's algorithm with fewer (pure) qubits

I found [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0601097) by Christof Zalka on optimizing Shor's algorithm. This is a problem I worked on while I was an undergraduate student and published in this paper: [Factoring in a Dissipative Quantum Computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9601021). I hadn't seen this paper before and I want to read it to understand how he manages to reduce considerably the number of bits needed to factor a *n* bit number.
