## ZX Art

![ZX Spectrum 128k](/assets/imgs/2020-06-08/ZX_Spectrum128K.jpg)

Although I never had a ZX Spectrum and find the color pallette pretty ugly I find that still people are able to create a lot of great art on it. I found out about ZXArt, which is a huge repository of everything ZX Spectrum. Hera are some of the images I found recently and I like. [[ZXArt]](http://zxart.ee). There is also a URL which has a simple interface for limited hardware devices [https://zxart.ee/simple/](https://zxart.ee/simple/)

Incredible demo, winner for the **zx demo** compo @ Chaos Constructions 2019. [[YouTube]](https://youtu.be/ZcYO_Kt57ZA). [[Pouet]](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=82745). You can watch it online [[here]](https://zxart.ee/eng/software/demoscene/demo/trackmo/theend1/)

## RCLONE

This week I discovered R**CLONE**. From their website: "Rclone is a command line program to manage files on cloud storage. It is a feature rich alternative to cloud vendors' web storage interfaces. Over 40 cloud storage products support rclone including S3 object stores, business & consumer file storage services, as well as standard transfer protocols.".
After learning about R**CLONE** I received an email from **Dropbox** telling me my renewal is upcoming and I need to update my credit card information. I like Dropbox as a service but unfortunately I feel their pricing policy to be abusive. They provide you with only two possibilities (at least for my usage): free 2GB or U$S120/year for 2TB. That's it. For the past year I've only used less than 20GB and there is no intermediate plan. To make things worse they pester me to upgrade to Business which is even more expensive. I'm through. I will use R**CLONE** to move everything to my current Google Drive which I'm already paying and have enough space. If at some point I need more space I'll move part of it to Amazon S3 which suuuper cheap. Here's a link to R**CLONE**:

## Apple II - experiment 02 and 03

I kept experimenting with AppleSoft on the Apple II to create 'generative art'. I find this images interesting. Later I will try to use them to create a demo but for the moment they are just static. Here are the two experiments I worked on this week.

### Experiment 02 - Gradient

This one is basically a gradient but with random light-dark pattern. I created a version in Applesoft and also one in 6502. 

![exp 02 - basic](/assets/imgs/2020-06-08/gradient-12.png)

```
10 GR : HOME : COLOR = 13
15 N = 17
20 FOR X = 4 TO 33
30 X2 = N * N * N / 65536
40 FOR Y = 4 TO 38 STEP 2
50 P = RND(1)
60 IF X2>P THEN PLOT X,Y: PLOT X,Y+1
70 NEXT Y: N = N + 1: NEXT X
80 HTAB 6:VTAB 22:PRINT "g . r . a . d . i . e . n . t" 
100 GOTO 100
```

![exp 02 - 6502 assembly](/assets/imgs/2020-06-08/gradient-asm-01.png)

This is the 6502 version. I didn't try to make it smaller but I'm sure I can reduce it considerably. Right now it weights in 130 bytes. The way this code works is basically `PROB` is a "probabilty distribution" that gives the probablity that the pixel will be painted yellow and the `SEED` is a random number. Right now the distribution grows as `2^n` where `n` is the iteration. This is increased every 4 columns. A way to get something better would be to provide the probability distribution as data as a function of column. This would be much better for aesthetic reasons but might not good for size.

### Experiment 03 - Islamic pattern

This one is based on a pattern I found in Pinterest that belongs to the site [Patterns in Islamic Art](https://patterninislamicart.com/drawings-diagrams-analyses/6/pattern-islamic-art). This site has a lot of interesting looking patterns and I plan to try other things. For now I have an AppleSoft basic I might eventually convert into 6502 assembly.
