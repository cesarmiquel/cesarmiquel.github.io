# 80x86 programing + ANSI art

So .. I wanted to write an 8086 assembly file which displays an ANSI image. To do so I:

- used the [Moebius ANSI editor](https://blocktronics.github.io/moebius/) to generate an `.xb` (XBIN) file
- to simplify my life I chose an image that fits in the stadard screen (80x25)
- I used the [Kaitai IDE](https://ide.kaitai.io/) to generate a `.ksy` file to be able to parse the `.xb` image and extract the image data
- Used kaitai to generate a Python parser to read XBIN files (`kaitai-struct-compiler xbin.xsy --target python`) which generates `xb.py`
- I wrote a small `Python` program to extract the raw image data into a file (see below)
- Finally I wrote a small assembly language program for NASM to output the image into the screen

## Kaitai specification for XBIN

This spec file is not the complete specification for XBIN. It has several limitations to the type of `.xb` files it can parse. They are:

- can't handle compressed images
- assumes that if there are fonts its 256 characters (`has_512_chars = 0`)

```

## Python program to read image and extract character/attribute data

This is the Python program which reads a file called `ansi.xb` and generates a file called `content.bin` with the character/attribut content of the image.
```
from xb import Xb

# Read file
ansi = Xb.from_file('ansi.xb')

# Print width / height
print(ansi.hdr.width)
print(ansi.hdr.height)

# calculate size
size = ansi.hdr.height * ansi.hdr.width * 2

# read content area
ansi.content.content._io.seek(0)
content = ansi.content.content._io.read_bytes_full()

# output to a file
filename = 'content.bin'
open(filename, 'wb').write(content)
```
## The Nasm program to display the image on the screen

```
; Image size
%define image_width         80
%define image_height        25

org 100h
s:
    mov ax, 0x03            ; setup VGA
	int 0x10

    cld                     ; clear direction flag used by movsw
    lea si, [ansi]          ; load source index with image address
    lea di, 0               ; load destination index with 0
    mov ax, 0xb800          ; load es with 0xb800 (VGA screen memory segment)
    push ax
    pop es
    ; load cx with number of words to move
    mov cx, image_width*image_height
    rep movsw               ; move it
    ret

ansi:
    incbin "content.bin", 0, 2*image_width*image_height
```

The program works as follow:

- setup mode 0x3 (80x25 chars)
- copy from the current data segment the image in `ansi` label into `b800:0000` which is the VGA text memory using the `movsw` instruction.
- to compile you can use: `nasm dispansi.asm -fbin -o dispansi.com`

# More about TextDemos

- [Text mode Demo Contest 20 site](https://tmdc.scene.org/) is a site with lots of text mode demos. From the site: "TMDC is a pseudo-annual demo-making contest held over the internet. After tAAt ry announced they would stop organizing TMDC after the 10th edition, members of the Northern Dragons offered themselves to keep TMDC alive."

From the site you can download a lot of very cool text demos. You can also download a demo template to get you started: [Text Demo template @Pouet](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=51945).
