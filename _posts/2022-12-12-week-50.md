# Configure HP Laserjet 107w under Linux

This weekend I had to re-configure my HP Laserjet network settings because I changed the access point. For some reason the HP mobile app would not find the printer. To re-configure it I ended up doing the following:

1. Reset the network settings by pressing the WIFI button on the printer for 20 seconds
2. Once the printer is reset it creates an open Wifi network. You can connect your computer to it.
3. Once connected to the WIFI you can check the IP address and point your browser to the `.1` IP. For example: it gave me an address `192.168.223.231` so I connected to `https://192.168.223.1`
4. From there you can click `login` as and login as the `admin` user (no password is the default).
5. From the web interface you can configure most of what you need. The most important is the Wifi settings in **Settings** menu:
