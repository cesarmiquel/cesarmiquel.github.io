# A Logic Analyzer with an ESP32

![Sigrok screenshot](/assets/imgs/2022-08-15/sigrok.png)

- [A flexible Arduino SUMP Logic Analyzer Library](https://github.com/pschatzmann/logic-analyzer) - This is a single codebase which can be compiled for an ESP32, Raspberry Pico, ESP8266 and an AVR. I made it work but wasn't fast enough for what I needed.
- To read the captured that I used [sigrok](https://sigrok.org/wiki/Main_Page) which allows you to read from all kinds of logic analyzers and testers, etc. For communication the above uses a simple protocol over USB serial called [Sump](https://www.sump.org/projects/analyzer/protocol/). 
- You can capture to a file with the CLI tool (`sigrok-cli`)

This will connect and get the information from the device:
```
$ sigrok-cli -d ols:conn=/dev/ttyUSB1:serialcomm=921600/8n1  -l 3 --scan  --show
sr: openbench-logic-sniffer: Probing /dev/ttyUSB1.
sr: openbench-logic-sniffer: Disabling demux mode.
The following devices were found:
ols - Arduino-ESP32 FPGA version 01.0 with 8 channels: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
To capture some data you can do:
```
$ sigrok-cli -d ols:conn=/dev/ttyUSB1:serialcomm=921600/8n1  -l 3 --samples 1k -o out.sr --config samplerate=3m
```

- [EUA/ESP32_LogicAnalyzer](https://github.com/EUA/ESP32_LogicAnalyzer) - This logic analyzer is supposed to capture up to 20M but I wasn't able to make it work. I need to investigate how it captures so fats (from what I saw it uses the ESP32 I2S support but don't really know how it works).

# Generating Composite Video on an ESP32

It turns out it's quite simple to generate a monochrome composite video signal on the ESP32! Here are some cool projects which allow you to do so:

- [ESP32 Composite Video](https://bitluni.net/esp32-composite-video) - The code generates an analog signal using the internal DAC according to the PAL and NTSC standards described here.
- [ESP_8_BIT Color Composite Video Out Library](https://github.com/Roger-random/ESP_8_BIT_composite) - The composite video generation code from SEGA emulator of ESP_8_BIT extracted and packaged into a standalone Arduino library so everyone can write Arduino sketches that output a color composite video signal. NTSC and PAL are both supported.

# Media Party 2022 - Blockchain for journalists + Cookiecutter

This week was the Media Party: the 3 day event is the most importante news media event in latin america. I attended three workshops that I found interesting so I'll mention what I saw briefly.

- **Web 3 from the basics of wallets and NFTs to next big things** - This workshop went through the basics of browser-based wallets, smart contracts, NFTs and other tokens with a focus on the Ethereum blockchain. We will publish content on chain, mint NFTs and transfer tokens. He showcased a couple of useful tools: [Mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz/): a publishing platform that publishes to the eth blockchain. [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) - shows you all Ethereum transactions and allows you to find wallets and NFTs using "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Lookup". [Metamask](https://metamask.io/): A crypto wallet & gateway to blockchain apps. I installed the plugin. [Eric Mack TW](https://twitter.com/ericcmack) - The person that gave this workshop. [Journodao](https://journodao.xyz/) - JournoDAO is an incubator for projects that transform and rethink the journalism ecosystem.
- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) - A cross-platform command-line utility that creates projects from cookiecutters (project templates), e.g. Python package projects, C projects. Great and very simple way to create projects from templates.
- [Newspack](https://newspack.pub) - "Newspack is an all-in-one publishing platform that incorporates industry best practices to help small and medium-sized news organizations produce great journalism, drive audience, and generate revenue.". The workshop went over the basics of Newspack.
