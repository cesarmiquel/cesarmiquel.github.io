# Flashparty 2023

This weekend was the Flashparty 25th aniversary here in Buenos Aires, ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·. There were a lot of interesting things happening. He's a summary of the things I enjoyed.

## My favorite PETSCIIs

These are my favorite entries in the PETSCII compo.

## Mod 7

I wrote an entry for FP23 called "Mod 7". It's a 256 byte textmode MSDOS intro. It requires a Sound Blaster Pro and uses the OPL3 chip with 3 channels and two instruments. The music is synced with the (very simple) visuals. This has been tested in dosbox 0.74-3 and can be compiled with nasm version 2.16.x. The visuals are a version of the examples presented here:

which come from this Twitter thread:

The sourcecode is included in the ZIP and will soon add writeup in here.

# Cellular automata to generate sequences

- [A construction of five-state real-time Fibonacci sequence generator](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10015-016-0309-2) - "In this paper, we propose a five-state real-time generator for Fibonacci sequence and give a formal proof of the correctness of the generator. The proposed five-state Fibonacci sequence generator is optimum in generation steps, and it is realized on a smallest, known at present finite state automaton in the number of states.". Couldn't get this PDF.
