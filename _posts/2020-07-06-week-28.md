From their site: "The CBM 8032 AV project is an exploration of the beauty of simple graphics and sound, using computers from the early 1980â€™s. This work is about the ambivalence between a contemporary aesthetic and the usage of obsolete and limited technology from 40 years ago. Everything presented within the project could have been done already in the 1980, but it needed the cultural backdrop of today to come up with the artistic ideas driving it."

## Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics

All the source code for the article "Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics" has been release in GitHub! In this paper by the Facebook Research AI Lab they show how a Sequence to Sequence neural network can be used to find integrals and solve differential equations (in one variable). Now they have released all their source code and data in GitHub.

- **Deep Learning for Symbolic Mathematics** - The paper in arXiv [[article]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01412)
- **The source code in GitHub** - [[GitHub]](https://github.com/facebookresearch/SymbolicMathematics)

## One Tweet Shader
