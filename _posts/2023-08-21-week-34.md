# üïπÔ∏è Wii Trimming

![The Louii](/assets/imgs/2023-08-21/portable-wii.jpg)

I had seen this guy some time ago and I came across a great video that reminded me this existed. Wii trimming is basically getting the motherboard of an old Wii and cutting it up leaving just the processor, the GPU and some other vital electronic circuits/chips while removing more than half. The 'trimmed' Wii is re-wired and fitted in a much smaller case. Here are some resources related to this.

# More on dithering/halftone

I love the dithered/halftone aesthetic. Here are some resources on how to achieve it.

- [WebGL Dithering](https://maximmcnair.com/p/webgl-dithering) - An exploration of image processing with GPU shaders in the browser. This particular one generates a dithered image
- [Comic book (halftone) shader](https://ameye.dev/notes/halftone-shader/) - From the site: "A while ago, I made a shader for a project of mine to simulate halftone shading. This note quickly explains how I created the effect."
- [Halftone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftone) - Wikipedia entry
