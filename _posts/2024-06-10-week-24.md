- Apple //c Arduino drive

# Apple //c Arduino drive

This week I did some additional research on how I can implement a floppy drive emulator on an Arduino to connect it to my Apple //c. Here are some of my notes on this:

- [Peripheral cards with the Raspberry Pi Pico - Oliver Schmidt (KansasFest/A24eVR 2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryiH8t4yIuw) -  This video re-ingnited my motivation to implement this. In the video they discuss at length how to hook up, in this case a Raspberry Pico to the address/data buses of an Apple 2. The author discusses several examples of boards and the intricacies of connecting these two very different type of computers.
- The video mentions how to handle the interface of buses that use different voltage levels. The Raspberry uses 3.3V while the Apple uses 5V. To be able to connect these two buses he uses [SN74LVC245A - Octal Bus Transceiver With 3-State Outputs](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74lvc245a.pdf).
- Looking at the schematics in the Fujinet project they use a different (but related IC) to hook up the ESP-32 (3.3V logic) to the Apple 2:  [LSF0204x / 4-Bits Bidirectional Multi-Voltage Level Translator for Open-Drain and Push-Pull Application](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lsf0204d.pdf?ts=1718362158867). From the datasheet: "The LSF family consists of bidirectional voltage level translators that operate from 0.8 V to 4.5 V (Vref_A) and 1.8 V to 5.5 V (Vref_B). This range allows for bidirectional voltage translations between 0.8 V and 5.0 V without the need for a direction terminal in open-drain or push-pull applications.". This are surface mount devices so thery are tricky to connect. In the schematic these are U3, U4 and U5.

- Another very interesting piece of information mentioned in the video is how the Raspberry Pi can use the PIO controller to handle communication in the background. [An Introduction to RP2040 PIO with CircuitPython](https://learn.adafruit.com/intro-to-rp2040-pio-with-circuitpython) - this article has a good beginner level discussion of how it works.
- Yet another interesting fact I learned is how the RP2024 (the IC that drives the Raspberry Pi) has the ability to load the firmware from a USB mass storage device. I find this feature very user friendly.
- The complications in matching the two TTL voltage levels convinced me that I will implement this on an Arduino so I went back to look at the ATmega328 datasheet (the microcontroller that is used in the Arduino devices) to see if there was some simpler way to transfer the data from the Arduino to the Apple 2c.
- Going through the datasheet I found two interesting options: **Chapter 19. SPI – Serial Peripheral Interface** and the, I think more promising **Chapter 21 - 21. USART in SPI Mode**
- In the later chapter it seems that what I need to use is the  **USART MSPIM Mode**.

## How information is stored on the Apple 2c disk

From the **Beneath Apple DOS** book:

- Apple formats its diskettes into 35 tracks.
- They are numbered from to 34, track being the outermost track and track 34 the innermost.
- It should be pointed out, for the sake of accuracy, that the disk arm can position itself over 70 "phases" To move the arm past one track to the next, two phases of the stepper motor which moves the arm, must be cycled. This implies that data might be stored on 70 tracks, rather than 35.
- Although the standard DOS use only even phases, some protected disks use odd phases or combinations of the two, provided that no two tracks are closer than two phases from one another.
- DOS divides tracks into sectors
- Apple has used two different track format to date. One divides the track into 13 sectors, the other 16 sectors.

From the [WOZ file format specification](https://applesaucefdc.com/woz/reference2):

- While every track can be a different size, this is rarely the case. Just about all 5.25 floppy disk tracks will tend to each be 13 blocks long. Each block is 512 bytes so in all a track occupies 13 * 512 = 6144 bytes or 13 * 512 * 8 = 53248 bits.
- The bitstream data is the series of bits recorded from the floppy drive and normalized to 4µs intervals for 5.25 disks and 2µs for 3.5 disks. The bits are packed into bytes, but the bytes will not necessarily be representative of nibble values as timing bits are also represented within the bitstream.
- If you are creating a floppy drive emulator for use with a real Apple II, then you will simply be stepping to the next bit in the bitstream at the rate specified by the Optimal Bit Timing in the INFO chunk. If the bit has a 1 value, then you send a 1µs pulse on the RDDATA line. For a 3.5 drive, the pulse width would be 0.5µs.
