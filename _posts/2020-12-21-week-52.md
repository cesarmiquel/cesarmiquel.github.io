## Sizecoding links and Resources

This week I found a couple of nice Sizecoding links that might come in handy:

- [SizeCoding.org](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Main_Page) - Main Wiki with lots of sizecoding resources.
- [Sizecoding Blog by TomCat](https://www.abaddon.hu/256b/index.html) - Cool tips for x86 sizecoding.
- [ikubun](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=79281) - Ikubun demo. Impresive 256b MS-Dos demo with awesome track. [src](https://jetlag.group/files/fsqrt+jetlag_-_ikubun.zip) [YT](https://youtu.be/qD9rYSAdGtE)
- [6502 based CPUs](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/6502_based_CPUs) - Sizecoding tricks for 6502 based CPUs and specifics for C64 and Apple II's.
- [Sizecoding on the Apple II](http://www.deater.net/weave/vmwprod/demos/sizecoding.html) - Some more Apple II specifics.
- [Small Linux demo toolkit](https://github.com/Shizmob/liner) - not useful for really small demos (~256b) but might be useful for 1k or 4k demos.
- [HardCode](http://hardcode.untergrund.net/) - Large collection of small demoes. From the site: "My name is Pirx and I adore intros. I collect them - my assemblagel includes thousands of small productions (intros, games, cracktros, BBStros etc). You don't have to search for intros, download and unpack them one by one - you can get world-biggest set in one ZIP archive!"
- [Generating Sine Tables from Parabolas](https://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:generating_approximate_sines_in_assembly)
- [minimum code pseudo sine wave](http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=2404)

## Issues with VIM

- [Slow vim escape from insert mode](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/16148/slow-vim-escape-from-insert-mode)
- You can also escape from insertmode by hitting CTRL-C
- I fixed it with `:se timeoutlen=5`

## Degree Zero: Drawing at Midcentury | MoMA Exhibition

“Zero means ‘nothing,’” wrote the Japanese artist Saburo Murakami in 1953, “start with nothing, completely original, no artificial meaning.” Bringing together approximately 80 works on paper from MoMA’s collection, Degree Zero: Drawing at Midcentury illuminates how artists used drawing to forge a new visual language in the aftermath of World War II. Modest, immediate, and direct, drawing was the ideal medium for this period of renewal. Mimicking the look of language, it appeared as graffiti-like scribbling, or borrowed from traditional calligraphies. Its geometric forms sought to communicate universal ideals, and its accumulations of marks reflected society’s new urge to amass.

Spanning five continents, the exhibition looks across movements, geographies, and generations to highlight connections between artists who shared common materials and ideas between 1948 and 1961. Featuring works by Louise Bourgeois, Yayoi Kusama, Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock, Alfredo Volpi, and many others, as well as recent acquisitions by artists such as Uche Okeke, the exhibition shows how drawing allowed artists at this postwar moment to start again from scratch.

## TIC-80 Fantasy Computer

From the site: "TIC-80 is a fantasy computer for making, playing and sharing tiny games. There are built-in tools for development: code, sprites, maps, sound editors and the command line, which is enough to create a mini retro game. At the exit you will get a cartridge file, which can be stored and played on the website.

Also, the game can be packed into a player that works on all popular platforms and distribute as you wish. To make a retro styled game the whole process of creation takes place under some technical limitations: 240x136 pixels display, 16 color palette, 256 8x8 color sprites, 4 channel sound and etc."

```
#
# TIC80 packer
#
#  Uses the zlib code chunk to crunch down your source
#  https://github.com/nesbox/TIC-80/wiki/tic-File-Format
#
# Usage: tic80packer [lua file]
#

import sys
import zlib

with open(sys.argv[1], mode='rb') as file:
  uncomp = file.read()
print("Uncompressed length: {} bytes".format(len(uncomp)))
comp = zlib.compress(uncomp, zlib.Z_BEST_COMPRESSION)
print("Compressed length:   {} bytes".format(len(comp)))
print("With header:         {} bytes".format(len(comp)+4))
with open(sys.argv[1]+".tic", 'wb') as file:
  file.write(bytes([16]))
  file.write(bytes([len(comp) & 0xFF]))
  file.write(bytes([len(comp) >> 8]))
  file.write(bytes([0]))
  file.write(comp)
```

Simple demos:
```
function TIC()
t=time()/99
for o=0,32160 do
 x=o%240;y=o/240
 xx=x-120;yy=y-72
    r=math.sqrt(x*x+y*y)/16
    a=math.atan(yy,xx)*11
    pix(x,y,(r+a+t)%4.94)
end;end
```
Onother simple demo:

```
function TIC()
t=time()/99
for y=0,136 do for x=0,240 do
  pix(x,y,(x>>3~y>>3)+t)
end;end;end
```
Cool sound demo (HellMood):

```
TIC=function()
for i=0,31 do
t=time()/10.
poke4(2*65438+i,i/(t%16))end
r=((t//100)%4)*25+100
poke(65436,r%256)
poke(65437,(r//256)*15+240)end
```
Demo in JavaScript:
```
// script:js
function TIC(){t=time()/1000;cls();for(i=5e3;i--;f(0,K=i%2,280,i))f=function(w,h,q,d){q>99?f(Math.cos(t*2+K)*h+q*Math.cos(d+t),w+q*Math.sin(d+t),q/2,i*i):rect((w+480+930*K)/8,(h+510)/8,1,1,9)}}
```

Another DWitter (https://www.dwitter.net/d/10433):
```
// script:js
function TIC(){
t=time()/999;cls()

for(;i--;)rect(
120+30 * Math.sin(i/n) * Math.sin(i+t/4),
80-30 * Math.cos(i/n) / Math.cos(t*8/i)
