## Sizecoding links and Resources

This week I found a couple of nice Sizecoding links that might come in handy:

- [SizeCoding.org](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/Main_Page) - Main Wiki with lots of sizecoding resources.
- [Sizecoding Blog by TomCat](https://www.abaddon.hu/256b/index.html) - Cool tips for x86 sizecoding.
- [ikubun](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=79281) - Ikubun demo. Impresive 256b MS-Dos demo with awesome track. [src](https://jetlag.group/files/fsqrt+jetlag_-_ikubun.zip) [YT](https://youtu.be/qD9rYSAdGtE)
- [6502 based CPUs](http://www.sizecoding.org/wiki/6502_based_CPUs) - Sizecoding tricks for 6502 based CPUs and specifics for C64 and Apple II's.
- [Sizecoding on the Apple II](http://www.deater.net/weave/vmwprod/demos/sizecoding.html) - Some more Apple II specifics.
- [Small Linux demo toolkit](https://github.com/Shizmob/liner) - not useful for really small demos (~256b) but might be useful for 1k or 4k demos.



## Issues with VIM

- [Slow vim escape from insert mode](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/16148/slow-vim-escape-from-insert-mode)
- You can also escape from insertmode by hitting CTRL-C
- I fixed it with `:se timeoutlen=5`

## Degree Zero: Drawing at Midcentury | MoMA Exhibition

“Zero means ‘nothing,’” wrote the Japanese artist Saburo Murakami in 1953, “start with nothing, completely original, no artificial meaning.” Bringing together approximately 80 works on paper from MoMA’s collection, Degree Zero: Drawing at Midcentury illuminates how artists used drawing to forge a new visual language in the aftermath of World War II. Modest, immediate, and direct, drawing was the ideal medium for this period of renewal. Mimicking the look of language, it appeared as graffiti-like scribbling, or borrowed from traditional calligraphies. Its geometric forms sought to communicate universal ideals, and its accumulations of marks reflected society’s new urge to amass.

Spanning five continents, the exhibition looks across movements, geographies, and generations to highlight connections between artists who shared common materials and ideas between 1948 and 1961. Featuring works by Louise Bourgeois, Yayoi Kusama, Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock, Alfredo Volpi, and many others, as well as recent acquisitions by artists such as Uche Okeke, the exhibition shows how drawing allowed artists at this postwar moment to start again from scratch.
