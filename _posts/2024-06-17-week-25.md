# Apple //c Arduino drive - part 4

![](/assets/imgs/2024-06-17/apple2c-booted.jpg)

This weekend I finally managed to read sector 0 of track 0 and load the first part of the OS on my Apple //c hardware! It took a lot of reading but I learned a lot of the details of how the Apple II hardware stores information on a 5 1/4" disk. Here are my notes:

- I started looking into the Arduino Nano processor datasheet to see if there was a way to send serial data easily without having to loop through it and send it, bit by bit on a pin.
- I looked at SPI which seemed promosing but after implementing it and getting it to work I realized that SPI work on a byte level and basically adds extra time between bytes really ruining the timing of the bits. I spent a couple of days until I realized it wasn't going to work. At least I learned a bit how SPI works.
- Finally I went back to the exising code used in the [SmartportSD project](https://gitlab.com/nyankat/smartportsd). Basically took out their `SendPacket` routine and used that code to send the stream of bytes to the drive.
- Looking at the signals with the signal analyzer I talked about a couple of weeks ago the timing is very good. It's not 100% exact. When you look at 50 bytes you get a little less than a microsecond accumlated error. It turns out it's not a problem.
- I used the `dks2woz.c` program to take an Applecommander DOS disk and covert it into a `.woz` file.
- Using the [wozardry](https://github.com/a2-4am/wozardry) python library I created a simple Python3 script which takes the `.woz` image and extracts the bit information of the track and dumps it to a C header file.
- With the 3 files: the `ino` that uses `streamData()` function and the disk header with the information I hooked it up to my Apple //c.
- An additional problem I came accross was that the Arduino has only 2KB of SRAM memory and a single track has around 6KB! To sort this out I had to put the track data in [PROGMEM in the Arduino](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/programming/memory-guide), chop it into 512KB blocks and send the data to the Apple. Eventually this worked because we are only interested in getting it to read track 0 sector 0 but in the long run I'm going to need to separate sector data because when the IWM is reading the track information it can't handle breaks which happen when we need to read the following 512KB from the track data array. I use `memcpy_P()` function call which is fast but it takes more than 300 microseconds to copy this information which will break things. My guess is that I'll need look at the track data and separate it into sectors and send one sector at a time.


![](/assets/imgs/2024-06-17/timming.svg)

- Of course it did not work initially.
- To debug the boot sequence this was really handy: [C600 ROM disassembly](https://6502disassembly.com/a2-rom/C600ROM.html). The code has a lot more comments than the listing found in Apple //c Reference Manual.
- To debug it what I would do is copy the `$C600` code into `$A00` and add `0x00` in different places from the monitor to break at different times and look what was going on. Like this:

```
] CALL -151
* A00<C600.C6FFM
* A5EL

LDA $C08C,X
BPL $A5E
EOR #$D5
BNE $A57
LDA $C08C,X
BPL $A67
CMP #$AA
BNE $A63
NOP
LDA $C08C,X
BPL $A67
CMP #$96
....
```
The previous sequence for example looks for `0xD5 0xAA 0X96` to read the sector header. By breaking after the last compare I can see if it was finding the header. This worked from the first time. Next I looked at the data that it was reading from the drive. To do this the key routines are `$C6A6 ($AA6)` which reads the 86 bytes with the '2' part of the 6-and-2 encoding. This data is saved at address `$300`. The other key piece is `$C6BA ($ABA)` which reads the remaingin 256 bytes and stores them in `$800`. To look at the data exactly as it was being pulled from the drive you need to modify the code to note 'decode' it. For example instead of this code:

```
LDY #$56
STY $3C
LDY $C08C,X
BPL $AAA
EOR $2D6,Y
LDY $3C
STA ($26),Y
INY
BNE $ABA
```

I would replace `EOR $2D6,Y` with a `TYA` instruction to put the byte just read from the drive and copy it to the `A` accumulator and two `NOP` instructions. This way after running this code I could see the data read from the drive in the range `$300 - $356` with:

```
* 300.360
```

Inspecting this data and comparing with the `woz` file it was exactly the same content. This was great! At least it was reading the first 80 or 90 bytes perfectly. With the same technique I looked at the data in `$800`. It looked exactly the same except for the laste 20 or 30 bytes which where completly off! Instead of having `0x96 0x96 0x96 ...` I would see secuences of same numbers but not `0x96`. Initially I thought the problem was that small offset in the timing which might be accumulating. I went back to the Arduino IDE and created a long stream of `0x80` pulses and measured the distance between them. Looking into this I noticed that in most places it was precisely 32 microseconds but once in a while it would be several microseconds longer. So that meant that it wasn't a cummulative effect. It was something else. Looking again at the SmartportSD project I noticed there were several calls to a **noInterrupts()** method! That was it! What seem to be happening was that every once in a while there would be an interrupt in the ATmega328 which would ruin the timing. Once I added this code to suspend all interrupts while sending the data everything worked and I got to finally read a complete 256 byte sector from the Arduino.

Here's the source for the Arduino code:

```c
#include <SPI.h>

// Track0 data
#include "track-full.h"

// Size of our buffer to transfer data to Apple //c.
#define BUFFER_SIZE       512

//
// To connect this to the Apple //c you need to connect:
//
// - pin 1 of the INTERNAL DISK J8 connector to the GND
//   pin of the Arduino Nano
// - pin 16 (RDDATA) of the INTERNAL DISK J8 connector
//   to pin D6 of the Arduino Nano
//
// Connect the Arduino to a USB to power it up and let
// the turn on the Apple //c.
//

#define CHIPSELECT    2 // pin 2 (D2 on the board or PD2)
#define DATABUS       6 // RDDATA of the INTERNAL DISK J8
                        // to (D6 on the board or PORTD bit 6).

// Declaration of code which sends data to the Drive
extern "C" unsigned char StreamData(unsigned char*);

void setup() {

  pinMode(CHIPSELECT, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(DATABUS, OUTPUT);

  digitalWrite(CHIPSELECT, HIGH);
}

void loop() {

  unsigned char track_buffer[BUFFER_SIZE + 1];
  unsigned int block_num;

  PORTD &= ~(_BV(6));    // set DATABUS low

  // We asume TRACK_LENGTH / BUFFER_SIZE is an integer.
  unsigned num_blocks = TRACK_LENGTH / BUFFER_SIZE;
  for(block_num = 0; block_num < num_blocks; block_num++) {
    memcpy_P(
      track_buffer,
      &track_data[block_num * BUFFER_SIZE],
      BUFFER_SIZE
    );
    track_buffer[BUFFER_SIZE] = 0x00;
    digitalWrite(CHIPSELECT, LOW);
    noInterrupts();
    StreamData((unsigned char*) track_buffer);
    interrupts();
    digitalWrite(CHIPSELECT, HIGH);
  }
}
```

the `stream_data.S` code:

```
#include <avr/io.h>

//*************************************************************
// Function: StreamData
// Parameters: packet_buffer pointer
// Returns: always returns 0
//
// Description: This will stream the data in X until a 0x00
// is found which indicates end of data. As input you get the
// packet_buffer address in r24 and r25. The output is sent to
// pin 6 of PORTD.
//
// This code is taken from:
//
// https://gitlab.com/nyankat/smartportsd/ file packet_16mhz.S
//
// I've removed the cycle count on each line but this code
// is cycle counted so you should not add a single NOP
// instruction which would screw all the timing. The code
// generates a 1us pulse and 3us delay (for a 1) and a 4us
// delay for a 0. It works perfectly with a 16Mhz Arduino Nano.
//
//*************************************************************
.global StreamData

StreamData:

          mov  XL,r24   ; mov buffer pointer into X
          mov  XH,r25

          // set transmit bit low
          cbi  (_SFR_IO_ADDR(PORTD)),6

          // same code as in SendPacket of SmartportSD project
          // ...
          // ...

enddata:
          clr  r25
          clr  r24                    ;return no error
          ret
```

and finally the track data:

```c
#define TRACK_LENGTH        6656

const PROGMEM unsigned char track_data[] = {
  0xff, 0x3f, 0xcf, 0xf3, 0xfc, 0xff, 0x3f, 0xcf,
  0xf3, 0xfc, 0xff, 0x3f, 0xcf, 0xf3, 0xfc, 0xff,
  0x3f, 0xcf, 0xf3, 0xfc, 0xff, 0x3f, 0xcf, 0xf3,
  0xfc, 0xff, 0x3f, 0xcf, 0xf3, 0xfc, 0xff, 0x3f,
  0xcf, 0xf3, 0xfc, 0xff, 0x3f, 0xcf, 0xf3, 0xfc,
  ...
  0xd5, 0xaa, 0x96, 0xff, 0xfe, 0xaa, 0xaa, 0xaa,
  0xaa, 0xff, 0xfe, 0xde, 0xaa, 0xeb, 0xff, 0x3f,
  0xcf, 0xf3, 0xfc, 0xff, 0x3f, 0xcf, 0xf3, 0x56,
  0xaa, 0xb7, 0xaf, 0xae, 0x5a, 0xce, 0x9b, 0xaa,
  0xf3, 0xb6, 0xb3, 0xa6, 0xe6, 0xb7, 0x37, 0xdb,
  0xb7, 0x37, 0x37, 0x7e, 0xcf, 0x67, 0x7a, 0x5a,
  0x9f, 0x9a, 0xd6, 0x5a, 0xd2, 0x76, 0x7b, 0xb6,
  0xd3, 0x9b, 0xee, 0xbf, 0x96, 0xf7, 0xa6, 0x77,
  ...
};
```

# Messing around with Orca and a Yamaha DX21

![Orca screenshot](/assets/imgs/2024-06-17/orca_01.jpg)

Today I connected a Yamaha DX21 keyboard to my laptop via MIDI and trigger it using [Orca](https://100r.co/site/orca.html). Here are a couple of notes from this experience:

- There are several links to the project: [wiki.xxivv.com](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/orca.html) / [100r.co](https://100r.co/site/orca.html) / [itch.io](https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/orca).
- The DX21 can be configured in **SPLIT** mode which basically splits the keyboard into two regions. You can then map two instruments to these two regions. This way you can have a bass (my favorite is the **Solid Bass** instrument and another instrument (**Celeste** is nice) for the other part.
- With Orca you can create different rhythms. This sounds nice for the bass and has a slightly off beat sound:

```
  .D2
   :04A1..
  .D3
   :04C1..
```
- Found a couple of good YouTube videos with tutorilas: [Learn ORCΛ Livecoding ~ IN DEPTH TUTORIAL (Pt. 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktcWOLeWP-g) / [Learn ORCΛ Livecoding ~ IN DEPTH TUTORIAL (Pt.2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKAjx6n97IY) / [ORCA Sequencer Intro (Experimental Livecoding!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaI_TuISSJE)
- The part 2 of the Orca YT tutorial shows a way to build a simple 4 track **tracker** using Orca. This is in a nutshell how it works:

```

```
- I used the version in [this source hut repo](https://git.sr.ht/~rabbits/orca) which compiled without too much effort in Linux.

# How to wire and use an ATMega328p microcontroller

While looking at Arduino related stuff I realized it might be useful to build a barebones ATMega328p based circuit for the final Arduino Apple //c project. I found a good video that show how simple the circuit is and a nice trick to be able to reprogram the chip using an Arduino Uno board. This is the video:
