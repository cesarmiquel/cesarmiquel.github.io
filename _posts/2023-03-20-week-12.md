- A single aperiodic tile


# A single aperiodic tile

This week a paper was published with another interesting result of a mathematical problem I've been following for years: aperiodic tilings. The question is very simple to state: can you find a set of "tiles" that can tile the two dimensional plane **only** in an aperiodic way? That is: a tiling which if you rotate and/or translate in any direction by any amount it never repeats.

This question has been solved many years ago and it was proven that such a tiling exists. Initially the problem was prestend by Wang using what are known as ["Wang tiles"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile). In 1966, Robert Berger proved that no algorithm for the problem can exist, by showing how to translate any Turing machine into a set of Wang tiles that tiles the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. The undecidability of the halting problem (the problem of testing whether a Turing machine eventually halts) then implies the undecidability of Wang's tiling problem. In this paper he found a set of 20,426 tiles.

Since then the number of tiles has been reduced to 104 then 13. In [Undecidability and Nonperiodicity for Tilings of the Plane](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01418780) written by Raphael M. Robinson. Since then the number of tiles has been reduced to 6, then to 5 and eventually to two by Roger Penrose. Tha question everybody has been asking was pretty obvious: can a single tile be found that only tiles in an aperiodic way? This week it was finally answered! And the answer is **yes**. Here's the tile:

This "hat" tile can onl generate aperiodic tilings. And this is the paper: [An aperiodic monotile by David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, Chaim Goodman-Strauss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798).

- [Pentaplexity - A class of non-periodic tilings of the plane by Roger Penrose](https://www.archim.org.uk/eureka/archive/Eureka-39.pdf#page=19) - One very interesting thing I found in the paper is a link to this article which was published long ago (1978) and which I never had a chance to read. Aprently the old issues of the magazine has been archived and opened to the public [here](https://www.archim.org.uk/publications/).
