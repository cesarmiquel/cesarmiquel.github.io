# A single aperiodic tile

This week a paper was published with another interesting result of a mathematical problem I've been following for years: aperiodic tilings. The question is very simple to state: can you find a set of "tiles" that can tile the two dimensional plane **only** in an aperiodic way? That is: a tiling which if you rotate and/or translate in any direction by any amount it never repeats.

This question has been solved many years ago and it was proven that such a tiling exists. Initially the problem was prestend by Wang using what are known as ["Wang tiles"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile). In 1966, Robert Berger proved that no algorithm for the problem can exist, by showing how to translate any Turing machine into a set of Wang tiles that tiles the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. The undecidability of the halting problem (the problem of testing whether a Turing machine eventually halts) then implies the undecidability of Wang's tiling problem. In this paper he found a set of 20,426 tiles.

Since then the number of tiles has been reduced to 104 then 13. In [Undecidability and Nonperiodicity for Tilings of the Plane](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01418780) written by Raphael M. Robinson. Since then the number of tiles has been reduced to 6, then to 5 and eventually to two by Roger Penrose. Tha question everybody has been asking was pretty obvious: can a single tile be found that only tiles in an aperiodic way? This week it was finally answered! And the answer is **yes**. Here's the tile:

This "hat" tile can onl generate aperiodic tilings. And this is the paper: [An aperiodic monotile by David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, Chaim Goodman-Strauss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10798).

- [Pentaplexity - A class of non-periodic tilings of the plane by Roger Penrose](https://www.archim.org.uk/eureka/archive/Eureka-39.pdf#page=19) - One very interesting thing I found in the paper is a link to this article which was published long ago (1978) and which I never had a chance to read. Aprently the old issues of the magazine has been archived and opened to the public [here](https://www.archim.org.uk/publications/). [This is the archive](https://www.archim.org.uk/eureka/archive/index.html).


# GPT

Some papers I want to read related to ChatGPT:

- [GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130)
- [Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Early experiments with GPT-4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712)
- [GPT-4 Technical Repor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774) - "We report the development of GPT-4, a large-scale, multimodal model which can accept image and text inputs and produce text outputs. While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4."

# Vim trick for special characters

A while back, we wrote about how to insert non-printable and other special characters with <ctrl-v> in insert mode. But Vim has another way called digraphs. (See :help digraph). While in insert mode, you can insert special characters in Vim by pressing <ctrl-k> followed by a two-character lookup code. For example, <ctrl-k> ?2 will insert the approximately equal symbol: ≈.

When would you use this? Note-taking for one. Write any kind of prose in Vim and you are sure to come across a use for a character that’s not on your keyboard: Currency symbols, dashes, bullets, and much more. Here are some you may find helpful. Notice how each two-letter combination (“di-graph”) is designed to be memorable. Certainly much easier than remembering numeric codes.

- oo • (bullet)
- Db ◆ (diamond bullet)
- '% ϴ (Greek theta)
- Pd £ (British pound symbols)
- Co © (copyright symbol)
- Rg ® (registered trademark symbol)
- Eu € (euro symbol)
- -1 ‐ (hyphen)
- -N – (en dash)
- -M — (em dash)
