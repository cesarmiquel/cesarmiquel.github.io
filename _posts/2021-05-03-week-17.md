# Tweet art

Every so often I like to go over my Twitter likes and post some of the images / art I like. Here are some of my favorites for this past weeks


This beautiful video was created by Dave Whyte (here's his [website](https://beesandbombs.com/)) with his social networks. He creates beautiful art with [processing ](https://processing.org/) and fortunately shares some of his creations as [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/beesandbombs). The code for this particular one is [here](https://gist.github.com/beesandbombs/f341a5728cf090189f37f51597541624)
