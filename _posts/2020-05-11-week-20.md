## Inkscape videos and blog

![Inkscape](/assets/imgs/2020-05-11/inkscape-new-features.png)

I found this good video which compares Inkscape & Illustrator. The author has many other videos on using Inkscape and a blog with lots of tutorials/articles. Highly recommended.

- **Illustrator vs. Inkscape video** - [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TXX10LdrhA)
- **Inkscape masterclass: Become A Master of Inkscape** - The Inkscape Master Class is a comprehensive series of 50+ videos where I go over every tool, feature and function in Inkscape and explain what it is, how it works, and why it’s useful. Think of it as an interactive user manual, in video format, that you can refer to any time you want. [[web]](https://logosbynick.com/inkscape/)
- **Inkscape tutorials blog** - [[web]](https://logosbynick.com/category/inkscape-tutorials/)
- **Creating Patterns Along a Path in Inkscape** - [[blog article]](https://logosbynick.com/inkscape-pattern-along-path/).

## YouTube Video on emulations

This veeery long video talks about emulation, cycle-perfect emulations and retro-hardware. On the video we have Matt Godbolt who wrote the JSbeeb BBC micro-emulator and jason Turner. Worth the view. [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbSRetQP-Xg). This is the other side of the video [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEyJ0z2iDhg). Mostly talks about 6502 processors. One very interesting piece of information discussed is that the opcode $87 which doesn't actually exist does a store A & X into zero page (AAX / SAX / AXS) [[reference]](http://nesdev.com/undocumented_opcodes.txt). In addition he show the Visual 6502 projects and talks about where the different registers are, etc. [[visual 6502]](https://visual6502.org).

## Another headless CMS

To look at: https://www.datocms.com/. NextJS blog hitting a DatoCMS: https://cms-datocms.now.sh/. For image resizeing it uses imagix API (https://www.imgix.com/).

## Apple II resources

### Applesoft snippet to view color palette
Small program to show the 16 colors available on the Apple II. Here's the code and 

```
10 GR : HOME
20 FOR I = 1 TO 16
30 COLOR = I
40 VLIN 5,35 AT 2*I+2
50 VLIN 5,35 AT 2*I+3
60 NEXT I
```
![Color version](/assets/imgs/2020-05-11/linapple1.png)

![Monochrome White](/assets/imgs/2020-05-11/linapple4.png)

### Google sheet with Apple II low resolution addresses

This Google sheet might come in handy to do some tests: [[GoogleSheet]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cm9qjEl-xkouhyVQyCfD7ShXyK1j0KRJN4ZoDkUBu5w/edit?usp=sharing)

![Apple II Low-resolution memory ](/assets/imgs/2020-05-11/apple-low-res-memory.png)

## Polynomial Optics: A Construction Kit for Efficient Ray-Tracing of Lens Systems

![Caustics](/assets/imgs/2020-05-11/caustics.png)

Very interesting paper on the simulation of light transport through lens systems. The paper is called "Polynomial Optics: A Construction Kit for Efficient Ray-Tracing of Lens Systems" by Mattihas B. Hullin, Johannes Hanika and Wolfgang Heidrich. It can be found here. [[pdf]](https://jo.dreggn.org/home/2012_polynomial_optics.pdf). Also there are some source code and other extra information [[here]](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2012/PolynomialOptics/)

## Carbon: Beautiful screenshots of your code

This is a web page where you can paste a code snippet and render a great PNG image of it choosing syntax highlightning schema of your choice. You can test it [[here]](https://carbon.now.sh/) and you can download the source from [[GitHub]](https://github.com/carbon-app/carbon). Here's my Apple II code rendered in it:

![Apple II scrolling code](/assets/imgs/2020-05-11/apple-ii-scroll-a-listing.png)

## ImGui: Bloat-free Immediate Mode Graphical User interface for C++

Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies). [[GitHub]](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui). There is an issue in the GH repo that has a lot of comments/screenshots of people using it. Its [[this one]](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/3075). A good example to test and see how it works in Linux is the one in `examples/example_sdl_opengl2` which, as its name implies, uses SDL + OpenGL2.

## Idea to generate Double Planetoid by M.C.Escher as a shader

I want to generate this image by renowned Dutch artist M.C.Escher:

![Double Planetoid by M.C.Escher](/assets/imgs/2020-05-11/escher-01.jpg)

To get started I should probably have a look at this shader [[Shadetoy link]](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/3dSXD1). Here's a screenshot:

![Paper City by NuSan](/assets/imgs/2020-05-11/paper-city-by-nu-san.png)

This Shader is inspired by this other Shader which I should study as well [[shadertoy link]](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/tsjGRG)

As another source of inspiration I found this image which I also liked:

## 8088 MPH Revision 2015 olskool demo winner

This demo was the winner of *Revision15* and pushed the limits of 8088 demos in many ways. I found a whole bunch of articles explaining the techniques and history which make for a fantastic reading. Here they are:

- **Links to YouTube and Pouet** [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHXx3orN35Y) - [[Pouet]](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=65371) - [Revision 2015 Compo site](https://2015.revision-party.net/)
- **8088 MPH: We Break All Your Emulators** [[article]](https://trixter.oldskool.org/2015/04/07/8088-mph-we-break-all-your-emulators/) This write up goes through the demo and talks about several of the effects and how they were done. There are also links to other more in-depth write ups.
- **CGA in 1024 Colors - a New Mode: the Illustrated Guide** [[article]](https://int10h.org/blog/2015/04/cga-in-1024-colors-new-mode-illustrated/) This more in-depth article talks about how to achive 1024 colors from a CGA card!
- **1K colours on CGA: How it's done** [[article]](http://www.reenigne.org/blog/1k-colours-on-cga-how-its-done/) Another article on how the color effects where achieved.
- **8088 PC Speaker MOD player: How it's done** [[article]](http://www.reenigne.org/blog/8088-pc-speaker-mod-player-how-its-done/) This blog post talks about the last 100seconds of the demo which playback an Amiga mod file on a standard PC.
- **8088 MPH: Sprites? Where we’re going, we don’t need… sprites!** - [[article]](https://scalibq.wordpress.com/2015/04/19/8088-mph-sprites-where-were-going-we-dont-need-sprites/)

- **Some thoughts on emulators** [[article]](https://scalibq.wordpress.com/2020/05/15/some-thoughts-on-emulators/) I learned about the 8088 demo from this recent article which talks about demos en emulation. An interesting read.

## Sound resources on an Apple II

Some sound related resources.

- **DMS Drummer a Percussion sequencer for the Apple II** This is the best in class for the apple II. It allows you to create and play a drum sequence on an Apple II with a decent quality. You can download a demo or pay U$S15 for the full version. Here's the link to the creator site [[web]](http://michaeljmahon.com/) and to the [[demo dsk]](http://michaeljmahon.com/DrumDemo.dsk) You can buy the DMS [[web]](https://8bitweapon.com/store/)
- **AppleCrate Polyphonic Music Synthesizer** Description of how a crate a 16 voice synth out of 16 Apple IIs. [[article]](http://michaeljmahon.com/CrateSynth.html)
- **Apple II Real-Time Single-Voice Music Synthesizer** 


- **Apple Duet** this is an old technique that allows for two simultaneous voices on classical hardware. [[article]](https://arachnoid.com/electric_duet/index.html)

## Apple II Code to Disk

This great utility will create a DSK image that will automatically load your code and execute it without the need of having DOS or ProDOS on the dist. Here's the GitHub [[repo]](https://github.com/datajerk/c2d)
