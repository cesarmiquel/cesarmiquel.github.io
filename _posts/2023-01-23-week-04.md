# Hacking garage remote controls

I wanted to understand how the garage door openers worked. I want to be able to have severals different garage openers in a single remote and wanted to understand how they worked. It's pretty straight forward. Here is the summary:

- Most remote controls use a 433 MHz carrier signal
- The controls basically have a number stored in them
- You can program the opener to "learn" the code of the opener by putting it in 'program mode' and then sending it the signal of the key control
- There are 'universal copiers' that can be used to copy the code from control to control.
- These usually have 4 'slots' where you can store the codes / patterns of other controls.
- You set them into program mode by holding the **A** and **B** keys together and then while holding **A** press **B** three times. See [this YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM_xgNsP4sQ)
- In all examples I saw you seem to need to reset the device to copy the codes. I'm still not sure how you can save one pattern to **A** and **later** save a different one to **B**. Need to see how this worked.
- The universal control I opened has a PIC12F629 microcontroller and an R433M Saw 433.92MHz resonator.
- Here are the pics:

- [This guys](https://lastminuteengineers.com/433mhz-rf-wireless-arduino-tutorial/) shows how you can build a transmitter and receiver
- [This is another home-made project](http://jasper.sikken.nl/garage/index.html) - "A 433 Mhz garage door opener was build using a PIC microcontroller. The 433Mhz signal from a garage door opener was received on a 433 Mhz receiver module for data ($3) and connected directly to the sound card of my PC. The signal was analyzed using audio editing software. On the basis of the timings of this signal a microcontroller program was written that similarly replays the signal on a 433Mhz transmitter for data ($3)."
