- Flashparty 2022

# Flashparty 2022

This weekend I attended the 2022 edition of the Flashparty. I was eager to attend because I had submitted my first 256b MSDOS entry for it (more on another post). Here are some of the highlights for me:

- [Post-Confinamiento](https://demozoo.org/productions/313679/) - one of my favorite entries. A beautiful, poetic animation. From the nfo entry: "Artwork made using mixed techniques including ASCII/ANSI textart, live action footage, filtering and frame-by-frame animation.". Very inspiring. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiN5txaLnZA)
- [Turner the Worm(s) in: Turn, Turn, Turn!](https://demozoo.org/productions/313681/) - A Teletex comic like whatever. By Mistifris group. I'm pretty sure it referenced a lot of stuff which I'm sure missing but it is a very nice animation.
