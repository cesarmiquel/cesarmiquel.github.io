# Kaitai Struct: A new way to develop parsers for binary structures

This weekend I re-discovered Kaitai Struct which is a project I saw a long time ago but never needed to use it. Its a great way to deal with binary format files. Even though I love JSON as a format it is very inefficient when you need to store a lot of data. In those cases the best you can do is use a binary format. Even though there are binary versions of JSON which are more efficient (i.e. [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/)) its still way to inefficient if you compare it to binary data.

Even though using binary data is more efficient it is much more complicated to read and process it. That's where **Kaitai** comes in. It is basically a very simple way to describe the binary data format using a YML file and then the program will generate a file in the supported languages.

Here are links to some resources:

- [Kaitai Struct Website](http://kaitai.io/) - The projects web page
- [Kaitai Struct Documentation](https://doc.kaitai.io/) - All the projects documentation.
- [Format Gallery](http://formats.kaitai.io/) - A user maintained library with many specification for popular binary formats.
- [Kaitai Struct GitHub repo](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct) - Github repo.
- [Kaitai Struct Visualizer](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_visualizer/) - This is a simple visualizer for Kaitai Struct project.
- [Kaitai Online IDE](https://ide.kaitai.io/#) - This is awesome: an online IDE you can use to develop the `.ksy` files and test them on a binary file!

# Tweet art

Horacio Altuna tweeted several very inspiring images by American artist **[Haddom Sundblom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haddon_Sundblom)**. His style is similar to another author I love: **[Robert E. McGinnis](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42080330@N03/sets/72157623002761081/)**. Here are the ones I liked most:
