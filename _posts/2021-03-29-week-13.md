## P5js

Inspired by [this Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ninasketches) created by [Nina Lutz](https://twitter.com/ninalikespi) I decided to play a little with the [P5js JavaScript library](https://p5js.org). I had been looking at some projects on Behance and came across the [this piece by Mario De Meyer](https://www.behance.net/gallery/85859433/New-Scientist-Space-Time).

Here are some of his process images from his Behance page:

As a basis to try and recreate something "similar" I needed to draw a toroid so started playing a little with **p5js** and got this:

Source code version [here](https://gist.github.com/cesarmiquel/9f8917ceb50b4c1eef2060ce78e9410e) , [here](https://gist.github.com/cesarmiquel/95dca0e2e05eb765a88de41c41a0178e) and [here](https://gist.github.com/cesarmiquel/03c34e1a0618964df4c3e06f47d89534). What I'm doing is following the equation of a toroid in polar angles theta and phi. I choose the angles by doing arithmetic mod 2 prime numbers so that they don't fall into a cycle (constants n1 and n2) and I change the color every 30 points by using a scale of colors I found in [https://colors.co](https://colors.co).


### Ideas to explore ðŸ’¡

I will probably follow up from stuff inspired by [this Pinterest board](https://ar.pinterest.com/cesarmiquel/graphicgeometric-designs/) I keep with Graphic and Geometric designs I love.
