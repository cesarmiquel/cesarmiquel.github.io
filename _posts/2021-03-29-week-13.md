## P5js

Inspired by [this Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ninasketches) created by [Nina Lutz](https://twitter.com/ninalikespi) I decided to play a little with the [P5js JavaScript library](https://p5js.org). I had been looking at some projects on Behance and came across [this piece by Mario De Meyer](https://www.behance.net/gallery/85859433/New-Scientist-Space-Time).

Here are some of his process images from his Behance page:

As a basis to try and recreate something "similar" I needed to draw a toroid so started playing a little with **p5js** and got this:

Source code:

Source code version [here](https://gist.github.com/cesarmiquel/9f8917ceb50b4c1eef2060ce78e9410e) , [here](https://gist.github.com/cesarmiquel/95dca0e2e05eb765a88de41c41a0178e) and [here](https://gist.github.com/cesarmiquel/03c34e1a0618964df4c3e06f47d89534). What I'm doing is following the equation of a toroid in polar angles theta and phi. I choose the angles by doing arithmetic mod two prime numbers so that they don't fall into a cycle (constants **n1** and **n2**) and I change the color every 30 points by using a scale of colors found in [https://colors.co](https://colors.co). In the last iteration I'm combining two toroids but with an offset **phi** angle and each uses a different palette.


### Ideas to explore ðŸ’¡

I will probably follow up from stuff inspired by [this Pinterest board](https://ar.pinterest.com/cesarmiquel/graphicgeometric-designs/) I keep with Graphic and Geometric designs I love.

## Twitter Generative Art inspiration

This [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/aemkei/status/1378106731386040322) had a lot of examples of art generated by the simplr formula **(x ^ y) % 9**. The oparation can be XOR or OR and the modulus can vary. Some interesting values are 5, 9, 17, 33. Based on an HTML / Javascript sample in the thread and my experiments with the previous palette here are some intersting samples:

![Pattern doing XOR](/assets/imgs/2021-03-29/xor01.png)
![Pattern doing OR](/assets/imgs/2021-03-29/or01.png)

The source code for both images is suuper simple. The first on is:

![Source code for pattern XOR](/assets/imgs/2021-03-29/xor-src.png)

The second one is just as simple but you need to change `let p = x^y` with `let p = x|y` and the palette I used has basically these 3 colors: **#f8f9fa**, **#6c757d** and **#212529** wich are 3 shades of gray.

Another example for the **BBC Micro** that blew my mind is [this baby](https://twitter.com/bbcmicrobot/status/1377285588714450948):

![lines](/assets/imgs/2021-03-29/bbc-micro.png)

Source code is suuuper simple:
```
 10 MODE 0
 20 VDU 5
 30 FOR x=0 TO 1279 STEP 2
 40 t=x/1279
 50 f=t*40
 60 f=f-INTf
 70 IF f>t MOVE x,0:DRAW x,1023
 80 NEXT
 90 GCOL 3,1
100 r=300
110 FOR y=0 TO r STEP 4
120 w=SQR(r*r-y*y)
130 MOVE 640-w,512+y
140 DRAW 640+w,512+y
150 MOVE 640-w,512-y-4
160 DRAW 640+w,512-y-4
170 NEXT
180 REPEAT UNTIL FALSE
```

### Tixy.land Generative Art Framework?

In the thread they algo mention [https://tixy.land](https://tixy.land) which is a minature visualization platform with a lot if incredible patterns generated by one liners: Here's one

### Color for Generative Art

For generative art color is very important. For my latest experiments I used these palettes:

![Color Palette](/assets/imgs/2021-03-29/palette.png)

The values for those colors are [in this Gist](https://gist.github.com/cesarmiquel/32ddbdd6ae1b2472e7351fc3334d3e92).

Related to colors I found these two interesting articles:

- [3 Levels of Generative Colors](https://samuelcho.medium.com/3-levels-of-generative-colors-b43bd0d6d609) - This article lists 3 generative approaches to color and is a personal account of this author.
- [Palettes - 1999](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/palettes/palettes.htm) - Great article by Inigo Quilez. He has two shaders 3hat use the technique described in the article:
