# Nintendo/GB related links

I'm on a Telegram channel with Gameboy related information. This week I went through the chats since it's been a while since I looked at it and found several interesting projects/links. Here's the list:

![New GBC clone](/assets/imgs/2024-06-24/modretro.png)

- [Modretro](https://modretro.com/) - Recently a new company has released a clone of the Nintendo Color Gamboy (GBC). It's a FPGA based emulator with a custom built 60x144 pixel sunlight readable backlit display and magnesium alloy shell. The specs from the site:
    - Compatible with Game Boy®, Game Boy Color®, and Chromatic cartridges
    - World's only 160x144 pixel sunlight readable backlit display
    - Super scratch-resistant sapphire front crystal
    - Magnesium alloy shell
    - Ultra-durable PBT buttons
    - Share gameplay moments with USB video out
    - FPGA-based emulation to play games exactly as their creators intended
- [RGB20S / RGB20SX](https://powkiddy.com/products/pre-sale-powkiddy-rgb20sx-handheld-game-console) - While looking for reviews of the new console I learned of the Powkiddy RGB20SX handheld game console which is larger version of the RGB20S. Both consoles emulate lots of retro consoles including the Nintendo Gameboy and Nintendo Gameboy Color.
- [FPGBC](https://funnyplaying.com/products/fpgbc-kit) - In the same video they mention the FPGBC kit which is basically a build it yourself kit which allows you to build your own GBC using a slightly modified GBC shell. The console has the exact same size as the original GBC with a slightly larger IPS LCD screen. It's a super cheap alternative to both the new Modretro as well as the famous [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket) which costs more than double the FPGBC.
- [GBDK-2020](https://gbdk-2020.github.io/gbdk-2020) - "GBDK is a cross-platform development kit for sm83, z80 and 6502 based gaming consoles. It includes libraries, toolchain utilities and the SDCC C compiler suite." Supported consoles:
  - Nintendo Game Boy / Game Boy Color
  - Analogue Pocket
  - Sega Master System & Game Gear
  - Mega Duck / Cougar Boy
  - NES
- [NES Bundler](https://github.com/tedsteen/nes-bundler) - Transform your NES-game into a single executable targeting your favourite OS!

![Furnace Tracker screenshot](/assets/imgs/2024-06-24/furnace-tracker.png)
- [Furnace tracker](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace) - I also learned about Furnace Tracker which is a great tracker software that supports OPC chips, C64, Gameboy and many other consoles. Full list on the site. It works great in Linux and will probably be my goto tracker from here on.
- [hUGETracker](https://github.com/SuperDisk/hUGETracker) - Finally I found out about hUGETracker, a Gameboy specific open source tracker. You can learn more [here](https://superdisk.github.io/hUGETracker/hUGETracker/interface.html).
