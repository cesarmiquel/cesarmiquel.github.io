- Emulating an Apple II disk with an ESP32 or Arduino UNO

# Emulating an Apple II disk with an ESP32

Last night I did some more research on emulating the Apple ][ disk using an ESP32 or Arduino. Basically there was a message in the FujiNetWIFI saying that it now supports Apple II disks! I looked at the code and they are using a feature of the ESP32 that allows you to modulate a carrier with a wave. It's very precise and simple to use. It's a great idea! The only reason I'm not sure is that the ESP32 runs on 3.3V and I'm reluctant to connect it to my Apple //c which runs a standard TTL 5V. I suspect it should work fine but ... don't want to kill it. I re-read some of the code for the Arduino and I belive it's not too complicated to write precise code with the correct timing for by cycle counting.

While reading about timing I came across a couple of projects that allow you to generate VGA from an Arduino that talk a little about timing.

## Links

- [FujiNetWIFI source code](https://github.com/FujiNetWIFI/fujinet-platformio/blob/rmt-disk-ii/lib/bus/iwm/iwm_ll.cpp)
- [Remote control module driver documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v3.3.5/api-reference/peripherals/rmt.html) - The ESP32 has a module driver that can be used to modulate a carrier signal with a waveform. The FujiNetWIFI source code seems to use this functionality to generate the bitstream that is read from the disk and send it to the IWM controller.

- [WOZ Disk Image Reference 2.1](https://applesaucefdc.com/woz/reference2/) - This is the specification for revision 2.1 of the WOZ image format. In it you can understand a little more how the information is stored on the disk and what is transmitted to the IWM. Here is the relevant part for us:

"On the Apple II, floppy disk data is written to the disk based on a 4µs clock. Whenever there is a 1 bit to write, the polarity of the magnetic flux under the drive head is transitioned from its current state to the opposite. If a zero needs to be written out, the 4µs clock is skipped (no transition occurs).

The MC3470 chip is the heart of the Apple II floppy drive. It reads the magnetic flux pattern off the disk and sends out a pulse for every flux transition it sees. This gives us back our 1 bits and our 0 bits come from the 4µs clock going by with no pulse.

One of the nice features of the MC3470 is that it has an internal amplification system to adapt to the varying magnetic strengths of each disk. If it has a hard time reading the disk, it can turn up its amp until it finds the signal. It allows the drive to read a wide assortment of disks. The Apple II uses GCR encoding to store bits on the disk. It is a very efficient system that was used widely on many platforms, because it doesn’t use clock bits to frame up your data bits, giving you more room to write data. This technique also has a drawback though, which is never being able to record more than two 0 bits in a row. It is why data on an Apple II is stored as nibbles instead of plain binary bytes."

- [Arduino Uno output to VGA monitor](http://gammon.com.au/forum/?id=11608) - This post shows how you can output VGA signals to a monitor, turning your Uno (or similar) processor into a "video card". In this code the writer is using USART in SPI mode (MSPIM). This has the disadvantage of adding a start and end bit which we can't control.

  sleep_mode ();

 }  // end of loop
```

On that same thread there is another way to do it: basically blit all DATA using the `PORTD` register. The timing is pretty simple. From the post:


The code to output the pixels is a simple loop:

```c
while (i--
    PORTD = * messagePtr++;
```

It relies on the pixel data pins all being on the same hardware port (PORTD in this case).

The generated assembler code is:


```
  while (i--)
    PORTD = * messagePtr++;
(2) 194:	89 91       	ld	r24, Y+
(1) 196:	8b b9       	out	0x0b, r24	; 11
(1) 198:	91 50       	subi	r25, 0x01	; 1
(2) 19a:	e0 f7       	brcc	.-8      	; 0x194 

-------
6 cycles in loop = 375 nS
```

Thus it takes 6 cycles (375 nS) per pixel, and the 60 pixels will take 22.5 uS which is inside the 25.4 uS allowed time for the visible frame.

By adding `NOP` instructions I think I can use this to output 1bit (4uS) rather simply.
