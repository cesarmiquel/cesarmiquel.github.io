## Practical Python Programming

Practical Python Programming. A course by @dabeaz. A very pleasant read which teaches basic Python programming. From the GitHub repos readme: "When I first learned Python nearly 25 years ago, I was immediately struck by how I could productively apply it to all sorts of messy work projects. Fast-forward a decade and I found myself teaching others the same fun. The result of that teaching is this course--A no-nonsense treatment of Python that has been actively taught to more than 400 in-person groups since 2007. Traders, systems admins, astronomers, tinkerers, and even a few hundred rocket scientists who used Python to help land a rover on Mars--they've all taken this course. Now, I'm pleased to make it available under a Creative Commons license. Enjoy!"

While the concept of SDR is not new, the rapidly evolving capabilities of digital electronics render practical many processes which were once only theoretically possible.
