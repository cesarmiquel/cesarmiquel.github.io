## Safe Bitcoin storage

I've been doing a lot of research for a good, developer level solution to storing BTC. After doing my research these are the tools that seem to be reasonably safe:

- **Electrum Bitcoin Wallet** - This is a software which allows you to create a BTC wallet starting from a random phrase. With this phrase a collection of BTC addresses are created. The collection of keys are stored in `/home/miquel/.electrum/wallets/<wallet_name>`. This file can be encrypted with an additional password or can be stored plain (obviously a **very bad idea**). The wallet is simply a `JSON` file which stores: the receiving addresses, change addresses, seed prase and other data. This software connects to a node server from a list of servers to communicate with the Bitcoin network and can sign transactions on it. It's Github repo is frequently updated which is not very common in many BTC projects I came across.
- **Bitkey** - This is a USB Linux distro that can be run *all from memory* making it very safe. One can boot from this distro, run Electrum *in memory and offline*, enter the seed phrase and sign transactions to transfer funds which can be passed via a barcode that can be scanned by your cammera.
- **Warpwallet** - "WarpWallet is a deterministic bitcoin address generator. You never have to save or store your private key anywhere. Just pick a really good password - many random words, for example - and never use it for anything else.". You can generate a unique BTC address (public/private pair) and use this wallet with **Electrum** to sign and watch transactions.



### Benefits

- **Bitkey** can be used offline and from memory. Your keys never touch a physical device.
- **Warpwallet** can also run offline and from memory.
- **Electrum** is simple to use
- Bitkey comes with both Electrum and Warpwallet.

## Update my Tiny-demos Github repo

![Microdose 128 byte demo](/assets/imgs/2020-06-01/microdose.gif)

Today I updated my **Tiny demos** GH repo [[GH repo]](https://github.com/cesarmiquel/tiny-demos). I added the **Microdose** 128b demo with links to a writeup the author did recently. I also added a lot of cool resources for `x86` demo programming. Here are the links I added:

- **Magic of 256-byte x86 intros - Jan 'Rrřola' Kadlec - Demobit 2017** - [[YouTube]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbWYBE9vjdk)

## Quarks and Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics

Following up on the subject of understanding Quantum Field Theory and Particle Physics my good friend Ezequiel Alvarez recommended the book 'Quarks and Leptons: An Introductory Course in Modern Particle Physics' by Francis Halzen and Alan D. Martin. I will read give it a shot.

## Chipzel: Video-game Composer//Gameboy Musician//Producer//Performer//

![Chipzel](/assets/imgs/2020-06-01/chipzel.jpg)

Today I discovered Niamh Houston, better known by her stage name **Chipzel**, is a musician from Northern Ireland. She is best known for making chiptune music, particularly with a Game Boy. I came across this tweet with her doing some magic with a single Gameboy + LSDJ that blew my head:

## Apple II - generative art experiment 01

I will try to create graphic procedural 'artwork' using an Apple II. This is my first creation based on the Fibonacci sequence.

![Fibonacci lines](/assets/imgs/2020-06-01/fibonacci-01.png?9)

Source:

```
1 GR : HOME
10 DATA 1,15,2,5,3,6,5,6,8,2,13,2,21,2,34,2
20 FOR I = 1 TO 8
30 READ X
31 READ C
35 COLOR=C
41 VLIN 6,39 AT X + 2
50 NEXT I
60 HTAB 9:VTAB 23:PRINT "f  i  b  o  n  a  c  c  i"
1000 goto 1000
```

To compile and generate a disk image I use AppleCommander (`ac`) as follows:

```
ac -dos140 fibo.dsk
cat fibonacci-01.bas | ac -bas fibo.dsk fibo
```

One variant adding a complimentary color (`DATA 1,15,2,5,3,8,5,9,8,6,13,2,21,02,34,02`):

Another test with white background and different "lettering":
